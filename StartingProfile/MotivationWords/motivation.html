                "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€“ which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition."

Accept it. You will lose. You will embarrass yourself. You will suck at something. There's no doubt about it."
